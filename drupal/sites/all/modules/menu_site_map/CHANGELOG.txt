CHANGELOG for Menu Site Map for Drupal 6

Menu Site Map beta4
  Bugs fixed:
    * #605836 - Show access to Select links
    * #629266 - Error in integration with Site Map module (actually array
                bounds checking problem) 
    * #605744 - List hierarchy is broken when Display style: Nested Lists and
                Move second-level items without entries to the end? are both selec

Menu Site Map beta3
  Bugs fixed:
    * #8 "Move second-level items without entries to the end" setting doesn't work
  Other changes:
    * Added README.txt file to provide basic documentation for the module.
    * Added LICENSE.txt to show this module is GPLed.

Menu Site Map beta2
  Bugs fixed:
    * #7 by mairav Fatal error: Call to undefined function 

Menu Site Map beta1 
  Bugs fixed:
    * #1 by mairav Home page link set to "<front>"
    * #3 by mairav Menu items not translated
    * #4 by mairav CSS issue when them functions output nested lists
    * #5 by mairav Duplicate text in links for nodes with path alias

  Other changes:
    * I made it possible to choose between either the header/div/list output (default) or the nested list output (which is similar to the way that the normal Site Map module renders menus with menu_tree_output().  Please select the desired output style with the "Display Style* setting at Site Configuration -> Site Map -> Menu Site Map (/admin/settings/sitemap/menu_sitemap/)
    * Instead of rolling my own links, I now use Drupal's l() function.  This seems to fix a number of the bugs.
