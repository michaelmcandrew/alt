= Comment Moderation module TODO items
Dag Wieers <dag@wieers.com>

== Ideas
- Create a new location at admin/content/comment/moderation
- Include a 'moderate' link per comment in the Comment approval queue
  (admin/content/comment/approval)
- The comment view should display:
  * Comment author/contact info
  * Comment content
  * List of links in content (best indicator for spam)
  * List of actions:
    - Approve
    - Approve and reply
    - Edit
    - Delete but don't report to Mollom
    - Delete and report as spam or unsolicited advertising
    - Delete and report as obscene, violent or profane content
    - Delete and report as low-quality content or writing
    - Delete and report as unwanted, taunting or off-topic content
    - Skip to next comment in queue
- Automatically move to the next message in the queue
- Add a comment_moderation_block to show the N number of most recent comments
  (by default shown to people that have permissions to approve comments)
